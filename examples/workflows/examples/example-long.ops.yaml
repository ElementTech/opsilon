# Stages Rules
# 1. All stages will run in parallel unless they have a "needs" field
stages:
  - stage: long # Name of the stage. These can be non-unique.
    id: somethinglong # ID of the stage. Used for 'outputs' and 'needs'. These need to be unique.
    image: ubuntu:latest # Override global image for this stage only.
    env: # Stage specific environment variables
      - name: onlyhere
        value: something
    # 'If' statements support normal mathematical expressions. 
    # Variables can be any variable available to the stage (Using '$' sign).
    script: # Array of arguments to the container. $OUTPUT contains an output file. every key=value here will be available for export.
